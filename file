Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques based on machine learning radically improve the ability of software to recognize patterns, use context to infer meaning, and accurately discern intent from poorly-structured 
text.

AI assistants represent a significant frontier for
 development. But the complexities of such systems
 pose a significant barrier for developers.
 This book will guide readers through designing a simple system
 that can interpret and provide reasonable responses to written English text. With this foundation, readers will be prepared to tackle the greater challenges of natural language development. Readers explore carefully-chosen examples and expand their machine's knowledge which they can then apply to a range of challenges.
